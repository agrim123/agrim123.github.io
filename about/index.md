Hello user, I'm __Agrim Mittal__ and welcome to my private space on the internet. I'm an undergraduate from IIT Roorkee. I am a software developer with a keen interest in network security.

Currently, I am working as SDE 1 @ [Zomato](https://zomato.com), hacking some awesome stuff!

I am an active open source contributor. I have completed the [Google Summer of Code program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/) in 2018 under Ruby org contributing to [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
