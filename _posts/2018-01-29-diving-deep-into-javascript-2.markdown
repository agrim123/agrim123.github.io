This post is in continuation of the previous post [Diving Deep into JavaScript (Part 1)](/javascript/2018/01/29/diving-deep-into-javascript/)

Continuing on my journey into the world of JavaScript, I came across some more intriguing concepts.

Topics covered in this post:

- Promises
- Async/Await


## Promises

> A promise is object that may produce a value some time in future, either resolved or, a reason that it's not resolved.
