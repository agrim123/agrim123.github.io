Sometimes, you might observe your program breaching all thresholds and taking up more memory than required. You might observe [sawtooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave) patterns in your memory charts. This is a sign of classic Memory Leak, which eventually leads to [OOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory).

Enter, **profiling**, a set of tools and techniques to identify and debug this memory-eating code piece.

> Identify bottlenecks, like, memory leaks, goroutine leaks or even get a trace of your function stack.


Go provides out-of-the-box tooling for profiling, `pprof`, available in the standard pkg under `net/http/pprof`.

## Setup profiling

1. Add import in main.go. `import _ "net/http/pprof"` This indicates a shadow import in which we are importing the library but not using any of its functions.
2. Add the below code to start pprof server on `6060` port which exposes `/debug/pprof` endpoint
```go
go func() {
    server := &http.Server{
        Addr: "0.0.0.0:6060",
    }

    err := server.ListenAndServe()
    if err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
        panic(err)
    }
}()
```
3. Now when you start your application, you can visit [`http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/`](http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/).

### go tool

You can leverage go tool pprof to interact with the above profiles and get some insights.

Example: `go tool pprof -trim_path=/go/pkg/mod -source_path=. -source_path=vendor http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs`

```bash
â†’ go tool pprof -trim_path=/go/pkg/mod -source_path=. -source_path=vendor http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs

         0     0%   100%  1927.52MB   100%  main.main.func2
         0     0%   100%       84MB  4.36%  strconv.FormatInt
         0     0%   100%       84MB  4.36%  strconv.Itoa (inline)
(pprof)
```

This opens up an interactive session, in which you can run some basic commands to get more insights:

1. top
2. top -cum

You can also get a clean `web` view by using the web command, which opens a tab in the browser: (You will require [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) for this)

By default, when using `top`, some nodes are dropped, you can disable this by using `-nodefraction=0`.

### Available Profiles

1. goroutine: stack traces of all **current** Goroutines
2. profile: stack traces of CPU returned by runtime
3. heap: a sampling of memory allocations of live objects
4. allocs: a sampling of all past memory allocations
5. thread: stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads
6. block: stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives
7. mutex: stack traces of holders of contended mutexes
8. trace: Trace of program execution

#### Difference b/w `allocs` and `heap`

allocs represents all the **past** memory allocation from the genesis of the program, including garbage collected values, but, heap represents the number of live allocated objects which **does not** include garbage collected bytes.


#### Difference b/w `flat` and `cum`

Flat means resources used only by this function, while cum (cumulative) means used by this function and functions called down the stack.

#### Getting trace of the program execution

1. `curl -O trace.out http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/trace`
2. `go tool trace trace.out`

This opens a web view where you can see the raw execution trace of the program.

### Seeing Go's gargbage collector at work

Go's garbage collector works in the backgroud and perform a STW execution at regular intervals. We can see what the GC is doing by running program in debug mode `GODEBUG=gctrace=1 go run main.go`.

This starts printing some information to console:
`gc 32 @1.158s 2%: 0.095+10+0.053 ms clock, 0.95+4.6/13/1.7+0.53 ms cpu, 45->80->53 MB, 53 MB goal, 10 P`

#### Breaking down the GC debug output

```bash
gc 32 @1.158s 2%: 0.095+10+0.053 ms clock, 0.95+4.6/13/1.7+0.53 ms cpu, 45->80->53 MB, 53 MB goal, 10 P

gc 32                        : 32 GC runs since the program started
@1.158s                      : seconds elapsed since the program started
2%                           : 2% of the available CPU so far has been spent in GC

// wall clock

13ms                         : Concurrent : Mark - Background GC time
1.7ms                        : Concurrent : Mark - Idle GC time
0.53ms                       : STW        : Mark Term

// heap memory
45->80->53 MB                : Heap memory in-use before the Marking started, Heap memory in-use after the Marking finished, Heap memory marked as live after the Marking finished
53 MB goal                   : Collection goal for heap memory in-use after Marking finished

10 P                         : Number of logical processors or threads used to run Goroutines.
```

pprof helps in identifying the bottlenecks, program performance and behaviour and proves to be a helpful tool to have in your Go arsenal.
